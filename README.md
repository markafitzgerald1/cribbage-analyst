# cribbage-analyst
Two-player cribbage discard analysis tool.

To locally configure and install, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [clone this Git repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), then run `npm install` to download project development dependencies.

(For developers:) To execute project unit tests, run `node_modules/gulp-cli/bin/gulp.js`.

To run the single page web application, open `index.html` in a not too old (IE 8 may not work) web browser. :)
